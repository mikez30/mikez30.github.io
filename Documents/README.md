# Heart Disease Predictor
Hackathon Project - Make a web app utilizing an AI model to predict heart disease based on 13 parameters:

  1) Age
  2) Gender
  3) Chest Pain Type (0 - typical, 1 - typical angina, 2 - non-anginal pain, 3 - asymptomatic)
  4) Resting Blood Pressure (0 - 250)
  5) Cholesterol (in mg/dl)
  6) Blood Sugar Levels on fasting >120 mg/dl
  7) Resting Electrocardiographic Results (0, 1, or 2)
  8) Max Heart Rate (60 - 250)
  9) Exercise Induced Angina
  10) ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (-5.0 - 10)
  11) The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0, 1, or 2)
  12) Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
  13) Thalassemia - (0 - Normal, 1 - Fixed Defect, 2 - Reversible Defect)

The AI algorithim is the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model
